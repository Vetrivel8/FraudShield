# Digital Banking Fraud Detection & Simulation Engine

## Project Overview

The **Digital Banking Fraud Detection & Simulation Engine** is a full-stack system designed to simulate banking transactions and detect fraudulent activities in real time. The system combines **rule-based fraud detection** and **machine learning techniques** to analyze transactions and identify suspicious behavior.

This project demonstrates how modern banking systems can monitor transactions, calculate fraud risk scores, and alert administrators when potentially fraudulent activity occurs.

## Key Features

### Transaction Simulation

* Generates realistic banking transactions.
* Simulates **SAFE, MEDIUM, and HIGH risk transactions**.
* Includes noise generation to mimic real-world banking data.

### Fraud Detection Engine

* Hybrid fraud detection approach:

  * Rule-based fraud detection
  * Machine learning fraud prediction
* Calculates a **fraud score for every transaction**.

### Fraud Risk Classification

Fraud Score Classification:

| Fraud Score | Risk Level  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| < 40        | Low Risk    |
| 40 – 69     | Medium Risk |
| ≥ 70        | High Risk   |

### Machine Learning Detection

ML model predicts fraud probability:

| Probability | Category               |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| ≥ 0.7       | High Fraud Probability |
| 0.4 – 0.69  | Medium Risk            |
| < 0.4       | Safe Transaction       |

### Real-Time Fraud Alerts

* Suspicious transactions are flagged automatically.
* High-risk transactions are highlighted for admin review.

### Analytics Dashboard

The system provides analytics including:

* Fraud rate
* Precision
* Recall
* Binary accuracy
* Confusion matrix

Current system performance:

Binary Accuracy ≈ 90%
Precision ≈ 100%
Recall ≈ 84%

### Admin Security

* JWT-based authentication
* Secure admin APIs
* Protected analytics endpoints

## Backend Features

* Transaction simulation engine
* Fraud detection rule engine
* ML fraud probability integration
* Transaction storage and retrieval
* Fraud analytics APIs
* Secure admin login using JWT

---

## Frontend Features

* Transaction monitoring interface
* Fraud detection dashboard

## Fraud Detection Logic

Fraud detection works using a hybrid model combining **rule-based scoring and machine learning prediction**.

Example logic:

Rule-Based Risk Score + ML Fraud Probability → Final Fraud Score

The system analyzes:

* Transaction amount
* Transaction frequency
* Behavioral patterns
* Suspicious activity indicators
